Assignment 1: Filtering and Mapping
Write a Java program that uses the Stream API to perform the following tasks on a list of integers:
Filter out the even numbers.
Square each remaining number.
Find the sum of the squared numbers.
Assignment 2: String Manipulation
Create a Java program that uses the Stream API to work with a list of strings:
Filter out the strings that have a length less than 5.
Convert the remaining strings to uppercase.
Concatenate all the uppercase strings into a single comma-separated string.
Assignment 3: Student Information
Design a class Student with attributes name, age, and grade. Create a list of students and then use the Stream API to perform the following operations:
Filter out students who are below 18 years old.
Sort the remaining students by their grades in ascending order.
Print the names of the top three students based on their grades.
Assignment 4: File Processing
Write a Java program that reads a text file containing a list of words and uses the Stream API to:
Filter out the words that start with the letter 'A'.
Count the occurrences of each remaining word.
Print the word and its count in descending order of count.
Assignment 5: Data Transformation
Create a class Person with attributes name, gender, and age. Given a list of persons, use the Stream API to:
Filter out persons with age less than 30.
Map the remaining persons to a new list containing only their names.
Print the distinct names in alphabetical order.

Multi-Threading Assignments
11:23
Assignment 1: Write a Java program that demonstrates the basic concept of multithreading. Create two threads that print numbers from 1 to 10 concurrently. Ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions.
Assignment 2: Develop a multithreaded Java program to simulate a bank account transaction. Create two threads, one for deposit and one for withdrawal. Implement synchronization mechanisms to ensure that deposits and withdrawals do not interfere with each other.
