Explain the difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap in Java.
	1. HashMap is not thread safe , ConcurrentHashMap is thread safe
	2. Performance is high  , performance is low
	3. concurrent hashmap is designed to be thread safe without synchronizing the whole map. it acheives concurrency by dividing map into segments
	and different threads can operate on different segments without blocking each other.
	4. If we do any modification while iterating over hashmap we get concurrentModificationException. In other case we won't get the exception
	
What is the purpose of the transient keyword in Java? How does it differ from static and final keywords?
  when we are serializing an object if we don't want to serialize specific fields or data memebers then we mention it as transient keyword. then that filed is not included in the serialization. While de-serializing the field will get its default value.
